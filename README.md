**Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)**

Titan is a fabric mod created to supplement [Saturn](https://github.com/ProjectEdenGG/Saturn) (the resource pack) on Project Eden.

Titan's features include:
- Auto-updating Saturn on game startup/texture reload
- Adds a quick connect button on the title screen
- Notifications in game when Saturn has an update
- Fixing unwanted culling of large custom models
- Telling the server what version of Saturn you have installed

Optionally, you can install [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to configure how Titan works. 

## Incompatibilties
Titan is incompatible with OptiFine (via OptiFabric). 

OptiFine was originally a great mod offering many quality of life improvements for the player in the beginning. However, over the years, its benefits have dwindled and has caused many issues for modders. This is due to Minecraft's codebase improving over the years and OptiFine's aggressiveness towards replacing entire swaths of code while being closed source making it very difficult to figure out why OptiFine has broken another mod.

In the modern Minecraft era, with Fabric's community effort, modders have begun to create alternatives for most of OptiFine's features to allow players to maintain better performance, better mod compatibility, and better support.

You can find a comprehensive list of OptiFine alternatives here: https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/

If all you're looking for is performance, we recommend:
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - General performance improvements
- [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight) - Light engine performance improvements
- [ForceCloseLoadingScreen](https://modrinth.com/mod/forcecloseworldloadingscreen) - Faster world load times

The staff team also often use the following mods to implement some of OptiFine's best features:
- [Bobby](https://modrinth.com/mod/bobby) - Larger render distances
    - [NoFog](https://modrinth.com/mod/no_fog) - More control over fog rendering ([Recommended Settings](https://i.projecteden.gg/nofog.png))
- [CameraUtils](https://modrinth.com/mod/camera-utils) - Zooming & alternative third person camera angles
- [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) - Connected textures
    - Requires [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) when used with Sodium
    - Remember to enable the Continuity resource packs
- [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - Shaders
- [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) - Dynamic lighting

## Recommended Mods
